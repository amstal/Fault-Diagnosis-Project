This script is a transformer approach to the Fault Diagnosis problem.

It was meant to be run on the HPC : La Ruche.

In order to run this script, you have to place in the same directory as the dataset.
The script is meant to be slow on the first run but after the dataset will be loaded in the cache and subsequent run will be much faster.
